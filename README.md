# Online Doctor Appointment System
## Project Description:
The Online Doctor Appointment System is a simple menu-driven Java application designed to simulate the process of booking and managing doctor appointments in a clinic or hospital setting. It is intended for basic interaction between patients and the system, where users can book appointments, check for availability, view the history of appointments, and exit the system. The application is built using core Java principles and provides functionality to streamline appointment scheduling.
